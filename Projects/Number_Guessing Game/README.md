# This is a C Project, called Number Guessing game.
# The program asks the user to guess a random number between 1-100.
# If the user's guess is correct, then the program displays a congratulatory message along with the randomly generated number.
# Otherwise, if the user's guess is incorrect, then the program displays an appropriate error message and prompts the user for another input.
# The program continues to run until it receives an end-of-file indication from its standard input stream.
